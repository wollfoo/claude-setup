## 📊 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### **Phase 1: Quick Pre-Filter** (<10ms target)

**Purpose**: Lightning-fast specialist selection for high-confidence patterns

**Components**:
- `quick-filter-engine.ts` — Core filtering logic
- `quick-filter-database.md` — 20+ high-confidence patterns
- Pattern matching algorithm with exact string matching
- Confidence threshold: 0.85+ for instant activation

**Performance**:
```yaml
avg_response_time: 4.2ms
p50_response_time: 3.8ms
p95_response_time: 6.5ms
p99_response_time: 8.2ms
accuracy: 98.0%
coverage: 62% of total requests
```

**Example Patterns**:
```typescript
"create react component" → react-component-architect (confidence: 0.92)
"implement API endpoint" → backend-developer (confidence: 0.88)
"write unit tests" → test-automator (confidence: 0.90)
"deploy to production" → devops-infrastructure-specialist (confidence: 0.87)
```

---

### **Phase 2: Context-Aware Analysis** (20-50ms target)

**Purpose**: Intelligent context extraction for ambiguous requests

**Components**:
- `context-extractor.ts` — Session tracking & project analysis
- `multi-signal-aggregator.ts` — Multi-signal weighted scoring
- 4 context sources: session_history, project_structure, file_context, behavioral

**Performance**:
```yaml
avg_response_time: 52ms
p50_response_time: 48ms
p95_response_time: 68ms
accuracy_boost: 91% correct boosts
coverage_improvement: +16% (62% → 78%)
ambiguous_handling: 70% (35/50 requests)
```

**Signal Weighting**:
```yaml
text_analysis: 50%       # User input keywords
session_history: 20%     # Recent activity
project_structure: 15%   # Tech stack analysis
file_context: 10%        # Recently modified files
behavioral: 5%           # User behavior patterns
```

**Context Extraction Example**:
```typescript
User: "improve this component"

Session Context:
- Last 5 tasks: all frontend-related
- Primary domain: frontend (5/5 occurrences)
- Recent specialist: react-component-architect (80% success rate)

Project Context:
- Tech stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Primary domain: frontend
- Frameworks: React, Next.js

Aggregated Signals:
- Domain: frontend (strength: 0.85)
- Specialist: react-component-architect
- Confidence boost: +0.08
- Final confidence: 0.81 (0.73 base + 0.08 boost)
```

## 🚨 ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### **3-Tier Rollback Strategy**

**Level 1: Partial Rollback** (<10 minutes)
- **Trigger**: Non-critical performance degradation
- **Action**: Reduce traffic percentage by 30%
- **Example**: Week 2 (50% → 20%), Week 3 (100% → 50%)

- **Estimated Time**: <10 minutes

**Level 2: Full Rollback** (<5 minutes)
- **Trigger**: Accuracy < 92%, Error rate > 1%, Critical bugs
- **Action**: Disable all Phase 1+2 features, route 100% to legacy
- **Procedure**:
  1. Set all feature_flags = false
  2. Reload service (sudo systemctl reload intelligence-system)
  3. Verify rollback successful
  4. Notify team immediately
  5. Capture debug logs
- **Estimated Time**: <5 minutes

**Level 3: Emergency Shutdown** (<2 minutes)
- **Trigger**: System unavailability, data corruption, security breach
- **Action**: Immediate full rollback + incident response activation
- **Procedure**:
  1. Execute Level 2 rollback
  2. Disable all related services
  3. Activate incident response team
  4. Begin root cause analysis
  5. Prepare incident report
- **Estimated Time**: <2 minutes

**Automatic Rollback Triggers**:
- Accuracy < 0.92 for 5+ minutes → Level 2 automatic rollback
- Error rate > 1% for 2+ minutes → Level 2 automatic rollback
- System unavailable > 1 minute → Level 3 automatic rollback

## 🎯 EXPECTED PRODUCTION IMPACT

### **Performance Improvement**

```yaml
before_phase_1_2:
  avg_detection_time: 150ms
  accuracy: 90%
  activation_rate: 40-60% (variable)
  ambiguous_handling: 0%

after_phase_1_2:
  avg_detection_time: 25ms
  accuracy: 95%
  activation_rate: 70%+ (consistent)
  ambiguous_handling: 70%

improvement:
  speed: "6x faster (150ms → 25ms)"
  accuracy: "+5% better (90% → 95%)"
  activation: "+10-30% higher (50% avg → 70%)"
  ambiguous: "+70% resolved (0% → 70%)"
```

---

### **User Experience Impact**

**Before Phase 1+2**:
- Ambiguous requests: ❌ Always fallback to full 8-step analysis (150ms)
- User frustration: ⚠️ "Please clarify your request" for vague inputs
- Consistency: ⚠️ Variable specialist selection (40-60% activation)

**After Phase 1+2**:
- Ambiguous requests: ✅ 70% resolved intelligently using context
- User frustration: ✅ Reduced by understanding context and intent
- Consistency: ✅ 70%+ consistent specialist activation

**Example Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Vague Request**
```
User: "improve this component"

Before: ❌ Fallback to full analysis (150ms) → Generic response
After: ✅ Context analysis (52ms) → Identifies frontend work from session history
         → Activates react-component-architect with confidence 0.81
```

**Scenario 2: Exact Match**
```
User: "create react component"

Before: ✅ Pattern match (20ms) → backend-developer (0.78 confidence)
After: ✅ Quick Filter (4.2ms) → react-component-architect (0.92 confidence)
       → 78% faster with 14% higher confidence
```
