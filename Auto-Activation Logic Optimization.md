1️⃣ Tối ưu Logic Kích hoạt Tự động (Auto-Activation Logic Optimization)

  A. Multi-Phase Confidence Scoring (Tính điểm tin cậy đa giai đoạn)

  Phase 1: Quick Pre-Filter (Lọc nhanh ban đầu - <10ms)

  purpose: "Fast rejection of obvious cases"

  quick_match_patterns:
    high_confidence_keywords:
      - "create component" → frontend-developer (0.85)
      - "implement API" → backend-developer (0.88)
      - "fix bug" → debugger (0.80)
      - "write docs" → technical-documentation-specialist (0.90)
      - "optimize performance" → performance-engineer (0.87)

    instant_activation:
      - if keyword_match >= 0.80: skip_full_analysis()
      - activate_specialist_immediately()
      - log_reason("High-confidence keyword match")

  performance_gain: "60% of requests resolved in <10ms"

  Phase 2: Context-Aware Analysis (Phân tích ngữ cảnh - 20-50ms)

  enhanced_context_extraction:

    previous_conversation:
      - check_last_3_messages()
      - extract_domain_continuity()
      - boost_confidence_if_same_domain(+0.10)

    project_context:
      - detect_primary_tech_stack()
      - identify_current_work_phase(planning|dev|testing|deploy)
      - adjust_specialist_priority()

    file_context:
      - analyze_recently_modified_files()
      - detect_active_domain(frontend|backend|infra)
      - apply_domain_boost(+0.08)

  example_boost:
    scenario: "User previously worked on React components"
    current_request: "add button"
    base_confidence: 0.68
    context_boost: +0.10 (same domain)
    final_confidence: 0.78 → ACTIVATE frontend-developer

  Phase 3: Intent Disambiguation (Phân giải ý định - 30-80ms)

  ambiguous_request_handler:

    vague_patterns:
      - "improve code" → Ask: "Which aspect? (performance|quality|structure)"
      - "fix app" → Ask: "What's broken? (UI|API|deployment)"
      - "make better" → Infer from context OR ask

    inference_logic:
      - if project_is_frontend_heavy: assume_frontend_focus()
      - if recent_errors_in_logs: assume_debugging_task()
      - if near_deadline: assume_quick_fix_task()

    clarification_threshold:
      - if confidence < 0.55: ask_user_to_clarify()
      - if confidence 0.55-0.69: make_smart_assumption()
      - if confidence >= 0.70: proceed_confidently()

  example:
    input: "optimize the app"

    step_1_analysis:
      - "optimize" → performance keyword (+0.10)
      - "app" → too vague (-0.15)
      - base_score: 0.55

    step_2_context:
      - recent_files: server.js, database.js
      - inference: backend optimization
      - context_boost: +0.15

    step_3_final:
      - confidence: 0.70
      - agent: performance-engineer
      - focus: backend

  B. Dynamic Confidence Threshold (Ngưỡng tin cậy động)

  adaptive_threshold_system:

    base_threshold: 0.70

    adjust_down_when:
      - user_history_positive: true (+reliable user)
        new_threshold: 0.65

      - task_urgency: high
        new_threshold: 0.62

      - similar_past_success: >80%
        new_threshold: 0.60

    adjust_up_when:
      - error_rate_high: true (recent failures)
        new_threshold: 0.75

      - critical_production: true
        new_threshold: 0.80

      - new_user: true (unproven)
        new_threshold: 0.75

  example_scenario_1:
    user: "Regular user with 90% success rate"
    request: "create login form"
    base_confidence: 0.68
    adjusted_threshold: 0.65 (trusted user)
    result: ACTIVATE frontend-developer

  example_scenario_2:
    user: "New user, first task"
    request: "build API"
    base_confidence: 0.72
    adjusted_threshold: 0.75 (new user)
    result: Ask for more details OR use universal-agent with monitoring

  C. Hybrid Scoring Model (Mô hình tính điểm lai)

  current_formula:
    confidence =
      pattern_match × 0.40 +
      domain_expertise × 0.30 +
      complexity_fit × 0.20 +
      resource_readiness × 0.10

  enhanced_formula:
    confidence =
      pattern_match × 0.30 +           # Reduced (often too rigid)
      domain_expertise × 0.25 +         # Reduced
      complexity_fit × 0.15 +           # Reduced
      resource_readiness × 0.10 +       # Unchanged
      context_continuity × 0.10 + NEW  # Session/project context
      semantic_similarity × 0.10 + NEW  # NLP-based matching

  new_factors:

    context_continuity:
      calculation: |
        if same_domain_last_3_tasks: +0.10
        elif same_domain_last_task: +0.06
        elif related_domain: +0.03
        else: 0.00

      example:
        - Task 1: "Create React button" → frontend
        - Task 2: "Add hover effect" → frontend
        - Task 3: "Style the button" → frontend
        - Continuity boost: +0.10 (3 consecutive frontend tasks)

    semantic_similarity:
      method: "Embedding-based similarity to known patterns"

      implementation:
        - Maintain embedding vectors for specialist patterns
        - Compute cosine similarity with user request
        - Boost confidence if similarity > 0.75

      example:
        request: "develop user login screen"
        similar_patterns:
          - "create authentication UI" → 0.82 similarity
          - "build sign-in form" → 0.79 similarity
        semantic_boost: +0.08
        agent: frontend-developer

    tier_3_specialists:
      - Lower-confidence domain matches
      - Activation threshold: 0.60-0.69
      - Examples: software-engineer, general-purpose

    cascade_logic:
      step_1: "Try tier_1 specialists"
      step_2: "If no match, try tier_2"
      step_3: "If no match, try tier_3"
      step_4: "If still no match, universal-agent"

  example_cascade:
    request: "make login faster"

    tier_1_attempt:
      - performance-engineer: 0.75 (not 0.80+)
      - pass to tier_2

    tier_2_attempt:
      - performance-engineer: 0.75 ✓ MATCH
      - backend-developer: 0.72 (login context)
      - ACTIVATE: performance-engineer (primary) + backend-developer (support)

    result: Multi-specialist activation, no fallback needed

  B. Learning & Adaptation (Học tập & Thích ứng)

  learning_mechanisms:

    pattern_reinforcement:
      - successful_activations: increase confidence multiplier
      - failed_activations: decrease confidence multiplier

      formula:
        new_confidence_multiplier =
          old_multiplier + (success_rate - 0.75) × 0.05

      example:
        pattern: "create component" → frontend-developer
        initial_multiplier: 1.0
        success_rate: 0.90 (9/10 successes)
        adjustment: (0.90 - 0.75) × 0.05 = +0.0075
        new_multiplier: 1.0075

        next_activation:
          base_confidence: 0.72
          adjusted: 0.72 × 1.0075 = 0.7254
          result: crosses 0.70 threshold → ACTIVATE

    keyword_expansion:
      - new_synonyms_discovered: add to database
      - user_terminology: adapt to user's vocabulary

      example:
        user_says: "screen" (instead of "component")
        system_learns: "screen" → component (synonym)
        future_matching: improved

    failure_analysis:
      - when specialist fails: analyze root cause
      - update_selection_criteria()
      - adjust_thresholds_if_needed()

      example:
        failure_pattern: "performance-engineer struggles with frontend perf"
        analysis: "Frontend performance needs frontend-developer too"
        update: "performance + frontend → activate both specialists"
        future_accuracy: improved

  adaptive_thresholds:

    per_specialist_thresholds:
      - instead of global 0.70
      - learn optimal threshold per specialist

      initial_state:
        frontend_developer: 0.70
        backend_developer: 0.70
        debugger: 0.70

      after_1000_tasks:
        frontend_developer: 0.68 (high success rate → lower threshold)
        backend_developer: 0.72 (some failures → raise threshold)
        debugger: 0.65 (very reliable → lower threshold)

  C. A/B Testing Framework (Khung kiểm thử A/B)

  ab_testing_setup:

    test_groups:
      - group_a: current algorithm (control)
      - group_b: new algorithm (experimental)

    split_traffic:
      - 80% → group_a (safe majority)
      - 20% → group_b (experimental)

    test_duration: 2 weeks

    metrics_compared:
      - activation_rate: % tasks using specialists
      - success_rate: % successful completions
      - avg_confidence: mean confidence score
      - user_satisfaction: thumbs up/down ratio
      - time_efficiency: avg task completion time

  example_ab_test:

    hypothesis: "Lowering threshold to 0.65 increases activation rate without harming quality"

    setup:
      group_a_threshold: 0.70 (current)
      group_b_threshold: 0.65 (experimental)
      sample_size: 1000 tasks each

    results_after_2_weeks:

      group_a (control):
        activation_rate: 58%
        success_rate: 92%
        avg_confidence: 0.78
        user_satisfaction: 87%
        avg_time: 12 minutes

      group_b (experimental):
        activation_rate: 73% (+15%)
        success_rate: 89% (-3%)
        avg_confidence: 0.72 (-0.06)
        user_satisfaction: 85% (-2%)
        avg_time: 11 minutes (-1 min)

    analysis:
      - activation increased significantly ✓
      - success rate dropped slightly (acceptable)
      - user satisfaction minimally impacted
      - time efficiency improved slightly

    decision: ADOPT experimental threshold (0.65)
    rollout: Gradual (10% → 30% → 70% → 100% over 4 weeks)
